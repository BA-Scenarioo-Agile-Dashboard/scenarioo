Scenarioo
==========

Automated documentation of applications through UI testing.

Scenarioo helps you visualizing and documenting the functionalities of your software in a guidebook, that contains the important user interaction flows of your software, generated out of your UI tests. Each so called "User Scenario" is presented as step by step page flow with screenshots and any additional useful information that you want to provide.

Scenarioo consists of a file format for such documentations, a webapplication that can browse and navigate such documentations (useful for all your stakeholders) and some APIs for use in your UI tests to produce such documentations (currently only for Java, more languages like Javascript, C#, etc. will follow or you could develop such APIs on your own).
