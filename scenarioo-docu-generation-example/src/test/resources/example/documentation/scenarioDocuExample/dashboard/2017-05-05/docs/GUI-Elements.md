# GUI Elements

There are four types of main view-types for the task of
 displaying "features".

Those are:
 - Features View
 - Documentation View
 - Dashboard View
 - Scenarios View
 
Then there is one other element, which is worth noting, the
 "Feature Explorer" which lists all existing Features in one "Build"
